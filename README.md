Teaching a webcam to recognize your face(alpha vesion)

To start a program just run cam.py file. 
Then you'll see your face in a black square, turn your head in multiple directions, program will save your face for training.
After that wait for a few seconds and watch the results!

Program needs further developement, because it recognizes all faces as yours(it reqires more dummy faces to train neural network).
